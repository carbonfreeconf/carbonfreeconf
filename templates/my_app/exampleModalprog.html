                                 <h5>It is recommended that you read all information here at least once before making your program!</h5>

                                 <p>You can prepare your program here and decide when it will be published on your conference website (in the 'Your conference website' tab). Note that the program starting and ending times are used to plan
                                 when the virtual rooms should be opened and closed. It will open one hour ahead of the first event in the program and will close one hour after the last event.
                                 Therefore, it is important to make this program as accurate as possible and double check that it is indeed happening at the time you planned. The program is displayed in the local timezone of users but they can change it to the timezone they like if they will.
                                 </p>
                                 <p><strong>Important 1:</strong> There is a 10 hour limit per day. If you go over that you will not be able to submit the conference.</p>
                                 <p><strong>Important 2:</strong> Always check at the bottom of the screen the red bits that reads 'According to the program, the conference will proceed as follows (please check the dates and times carefully before you last submit)'. It will tell you if you go over 10 hours or if there are any other issues with the program schedule. To submit your conference, no warning messages should appear in this part! </p>

                             <div id="step-1" class="tab-pane" role="tabpanel">
                                 <h3 style="text-align: center" class="mb-3">Different views</h3>
                                     <h5>Go to the program tab and check the day - week - month views.</h5>
                                    <p>When you consult the program first, you are automatically set in week view. It is usually the handiest view to plan your week-long seminar.
                                    However, when you are modifying a given day, it could be helpful to just see the participations for that day in a slightly bigger format. To do so, click the "Day" button at the top left of the calendar.
                                    You can also click the "month" view, which will show you a simplified version of your program. It is handy to quickly check all the presentations at once and/or if your conference is extending for longer than a week!</p>
                             </div>
                             <div id="step-2" class="tab-pane" role="tabpanel">
                                 <h3 style="text-align: center" class="mb-3">Add a talk</h3>
                                 <h5>Make your program by adding talks/discussions/reviews/poster sessions/lunch breaks...</h5>
                                <p>Here is the most important part that should be read before diving in the program making with other 'superuser' colleagues.</p>
                                 <p>There are two ways to add a participation to the program. 1) Directly by clicking on the calendar at the right time and day and dragging until the end time you want. 2) By going to the 'participant tab' and click the <a class="btn btn-info a-btn-slide-text py-0"><span class="fa fa-plus" aria-hidden="true"></span></a> button to the right of a participant's name.</p>
                                 <p>The first option is handy to add lunch breaks, pauses or discussion times. However, to add talks you should really use the <a class="btn btn-info a-btn-slide-text py-0"><span class="fa fa-plus" aria-hidden="true"></span></a> plus button. This is because
                                 then it will fill out all the important information in the talk's details without you having to add it later manually, such as speaker's name, title, abstract, participation's type. The plus button becomes active once you have accepted a talk.</p>
                                 <p><strong>Important 1:</strong> The program is independent of the participations, i.e., you can change the title, abstract, type of the talk in the program, without affecting what were submitted by participants.</p>
                                 <p><strong>Important 2:</strong> When you click the plus button, talks are added at the beginning of your program. You will have to drag the box along to the place you want the talk to happen.</p>

                             </div>
                             <div id="step-3" class="tab-pane" role="tabpanel">
                                 <h3 style="text-align: center" class="mb-3">Modify a talk</h3>
                                 <h5>Want to change the talk's details or delete it?</h5>
                                 <p>Once you have added a talk, you can click once on it and then click on the 'details' symbol that appears on the left of the box. It will open a new window where you will be able to change or add all the different details about the talk (e.g. speaker's name, abstract, time, ...). Always click save at the bottom of the details window to take into account your changes.</p>
                                 <p>Note that if you add a lunch break, you have to change the talk's type to 'Pause', which will also change the color of the box to make it clear it's not a talk.</p>
                                 <p>It can be handy sometimes for more accuracy to change the talk's starting and ending times directly in the details window rather than dragging the talk along.</p>
                                 <p><strong>Important 1:</strong> In the details window, ticking the 'important' checkbox will add a star at the top of the box, making it stand out.</p>
                                 <p><strong>Important 2:</strong> In the details window, tick 'not part of the conference' if you want to add something that will happen outside of your meeting (i.e., not in your virtual room) but that you still want to mention (e.g., a large audience public talk). Indeed, if you do not do that then the virtual room will open earlier or remain open for longer until this extra talk finishes (if it goes beyond the opening/closing times of your meeting), which is not environmental friendly, and may go over your 10 hour limit if not ticked!</p>
                                 <p>Talks in the program can be deleted either at the bottom of the details window by clicking the delete button or directly by clicking the bin symbol underneath the details symbol. Note that the third globe symbol under the bin leads you directly to the virtual room where the talk will happen (it is handy for your participants when the day comes and, e.g., there are parallel sessions).</p>

                                 <h3 style="text-align: center" class="mb-3">Export the program</h3>
                                 <h5>The program can be exported in different formats by clicking on the Export top right buttons <small>(it is also accessible on the conference website for your participants)</small>.</h5>
                                 <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Export to your calendar: </strong> Use the <span><a type="button" class="buttonmod">Export to your Calendar</a></span> button to get the program in .ics format (if you need the ical format instead, download the file and change the extension). Once you click on the file, it will copy the program to your active calendar on your computer.</p>
                                 <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Export to Excel: </strong> Use the <span><a type="button" class="buttonmod">Export to Excel</a></span> button to get the different talks in an excel sheet. You will get a file with one line per talk listing the starting and ending times, title and speaker's name.</p>
                                 <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Export to PDF: </strong> Use the <span><a type="button" class="buttonmod">Export to PDF</a></span> button to get the program in pdf. It is just copy pasting the program you are currently looking at and it will provide different pdf files for the day, week or month views.</p>

                                 <h3 style="text-align: center" class="mb-3">Customize how the program will look on the conference website</h3>
                                <h5>The devil is in the details: customize how the program will be shown to your participants.</h5>
                                <p>By default, the program will span 24 hours, which may not be handy for your participants as they will have to scroll down to see when events start. Also, you can play with the box/cell sizes to prevent overlaps between talks and more...</p>
                                <p>If you look at the bottom of the program, you will notice a form called 'Customize the schedule', which is made of the following fields (that should be changed for a neat appearance):</p>
                                <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Start time of schedule span: </strong> Your program will be displayed starting from this time (in hour, in your timezone) thus reducing the total time span to less than 24 hours if needed. It makes the program more compact and easier to read. If most users are from a specific timezone and not you, place yourself in the same timezone (see in the 'Conference details' tab) and then adjust the start time. It is also handy to look at the program from different timezones to see what will be shown to different participants and optimize!</p>
                                <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>End time of schedule span: </strong> Your program will be displayed up to this maximum time (in hour, in your timezone) thus reducing the total time span to less than 24 hours if needed. It makes the program more compact and easier to read.</p>
                                <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Minimum height of schedule boxes: </strong> This is the minimum height of a box in your program (make it 50 if you do not know). Too small a height would prevent from seeing information (e.g., speaker's name) of short participations.</p>
                                <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Height for each hour slot: </strong> It sets how many sub-cells can fit in a one hour time slot (make it 6 if you do not know). The greater the number of sub-cells, the easier it will be to read and separate the different parts of the program and avoid overlap (but too many sub-cells would mean too much scroll down to reach the end of the program).</p>
                                <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Under how many minutes does it switch to the mini format?: </strong> This is the size under which the box format switches to the mini format - a shortened format which does not display the speaker's name - (make it 15 if you do not know). It can be useful to make it smaller if you have many 5-10min bits that overlap with other talks (you should also increase the Height for each hour slot if overlapping happens and/or reduce the Minimum height of schedule boxes).</p>
                                <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Opacity of the boxes: </strong> Set the opacity of the colored boxes between 1 and 10 (make it 10 if you do not know). A value of 10 means totally opaque, and 1 is almost transparent. Make it less opaque if you think it is better for the eye.</p>

                                <p><strong>Important 1:</strong> To account for the changes, do not forget to click the <a class="btn btn-info py-0"><strong>Save new program design</strong></a> button.</p>
                                <p><strong>Important 2:</strong> Note that if the starting and ending times of your schedule span go over two days in the timezone of some of your participants then it will be displayed over a 24 hour span instead.</p>
