                <h5>This is the guide to explain what can be done from the 'Conference details' tab (i.e., the page behind this guide).</h5>
             <p>It is recommended that you read all information here at least once before making any change on this 'Conference details' tab! Note that other tabs (e.g. participants, program, ...) have their own guides.</p>
            <p>This tab is the home page of the administration panel of your conference. You can check important details such as the links to access your conference, access statistics about your conference, and more. </p>
             <p><strong>More importantly</strong>, you can refine the set-up of your conference here (e.g. say that you want to record the talks, authorize posters, ...) and you can also update all parameters that you previously input while creating the conference. </p>
             <p>There are two main parts on this page, which we will now describe in the next two steps: conference details (top of the page) and main conference parameters (bottom).</p>
         </div>
         <div id="step-1" class="tab-pane" role="tabpanel">
             <h3 style="text-align: center" class="mb-3">Conference details</h3>
                 <h5>You can refine the set-up of your conference by filling out the form under the horizontal dashed line.</h5>
            <p><strong>Important:</strong> If you want the changes you make to take effect, you should always push the <a class="btn btn-info py-0"><strong>Save conference details</strong></a> button at the end of the form.</p>
             <p>Let us describe each of the fields you can change:</p>
             <p style="text-align: left"><strong>Posters:</strong> Tick the checkbox if you want participants to be able to register and deposit their poster in your conference.</p>
             <p style="text-align: left"><strong>Payment for the conference fees centralized to the master session:</strong> <i>Only for the multi-session conferences</i> - It means that the master conference creator will pay for all the daughter session fees, and the fees will only be displayed in the master conference admin panel (i.e., it is only accessible to the main organizers).</p>
             <p style="text-align: left"><strong>Record the conference:</strong> Tick the box if you want moderators to be able to record the talks during the conference. Then choose if the talks should be put on Youtube and/or if they are public (i.e., they are freely accessible on CarbonFreeConf and Vimeo) or only accessible to participants (i.e., in this case it is not accessible freely on Vimeo but only on CarbonFreeConf for registered and validated participants).
                 Note that all organizers and moderators will be able to see the record button during the meeting and that they can decide to either push the start recording button once (and pause sometimes) and then stop at the end to get a long video of all the session or rather push start and stop after every talk to have them individually. CarbonFreeConf will then display them all and organizers can add a title to each of them (with, e.g., speaker's name and talk's title).</p>
             <p style="text-align: left"><strong>Participants can access to all parallel sessions?:</strong> <i>Only for the multi-session conferences</i> - Tick the box if participants validated in one parallel session should be given the right to access to all other sessions of the conference on the big day.</p>
             <p style="text-align: left"><strong>Abstract deadline for participants:</strong> Pick a date when you will stop receiving new abstracts or posters or any new participation (after this date, the registration page of your conference website will indicate it is too late).</p>
             <p style="text-align: left"><strong>Can the participants submit presentations?:</strong> If you do not want to allow participants to submit abstracts for talks (e.g., if talks are on invitation only) then untick this box.</p>
             <p style="text-align: left"><strong>Activate the questions and polls during the conference?:</strong> Check the box if you want to use our Q&A and poll tool during your conference (you can go test it yourself in a test room but we suggest you use it because it makes the meeting much more interactive and interesting). Participants have then one clear place to submit questions and they can upvote them (which can help the chair to ask the favourite questions when lacking of time). Everyone can also poll other participants, which can be very interactive (e.g. the speaker can stop during their talk and poll participants about a specific point, then display the results and finally give the right answer). It is also easier for the chair to keep track of questions or polls because they can be removed once answered or removed at the end of the talk. For your records, all questions and polls can then be retrieved in the Q&P tab on this page.</p>
             <p style="text-align: left"><strong>Do you want the daughter conferences to be named using some of the famous Star wars planets' names?:</strong> <i>Only for the multi-session conferences</i> - if you check the box, the short names of parallel sessions will be that of Star wars planets (e.g., Tatooine, Mustafar, Jakku, ...). If not it will simply be S1, S2, S3, ...</p>
             <p style="text-align: left"><strong>Should participants be automatically added to the master session (plenaries) when they get a participation accepted?:</strong> <i>Only for the multi-session conferences</i> - If participants are accepted in one session, should they be added to the master conference automatically to be able to see the plenary session on the big day? If yes, tick the box (and it would also add them to the chat room dedicated to plenaries).</p>
             <p style="text-align: left"><strong>Twitter Hashtag:</strong> Write the hashtag that you'd like participants to use when sharing results on Twitter. If you do not wish to do that, then just leave a # symbol in the box and participants will not see the latest tweets from our platform as it will deactivate our twitter tool.</p>
             <p style="text-align: left"><strong>Upload a logo for the conference room and website:</strong> Click this button to add your conference logo that will be shown on your conference website and in the virtual room on the big day. This is a nice way to personalize your conference!</p>
             <p style="text-align: left"><strong>Message to all participants:</strong> This message will appear at the top of the virtual room during the meeting so that everyone can see. It can be used to pass important messages to all during the conference (it is updated every 2 mins).</p>

         <div id="step-2" class="tab-pane" role="tabpanel">
             <h3 style="text-align: center" class="mb-3">Conference main parameters</h3>
             <h5>When you first created the conference, you set-up a few things that can be changed in the main parameter area.</h5>
            <p>If you go below the thick horizontal red bar on the page, you can see the parameters that you had previously chosen for your conference (e.g. dates, title, ...).</p>
            <p>If you want to change any of these parameters, click the <a href="#" class="btn btn-info py-0"><strong>Change these parameters?</strong></a> button and the same form you filled out previously will appear. Feel free to change the parameters and then do not forget to click
            the <a href="#" class="btn btn-success py-0"><strong>Update these parameters</strong></a> button for changes to take effect.</p>
             <p>If you do not remember what the different parameters correspond to, go back to the guide on the initial creation page by clicking the <a class="btn btn-success btn-default3 py-0">Create another conference from scratch</a> button at the top of the screen or use the list down here:</p>

             <p style="text-align: left"><strong>Title:</strong> This is the title of your conference (or session if you are creating several parallel sessions, see later).</p>
             <p style="text-align: left"><strong>Abstract:</strong> This is what your conference will be about (it will be displayed on our website).</p>
             <p style="text-align: left"><strong>Public or Private:</strong> Private conferences can only be accessed by participants that have registered to the conference and have been validated by organizers. Public conferences can be accessed by everyone with the right link (a long complicated link is provided to organizers and they are free to share it to participants of interest or to display it publicly). Note that zoom-bombing is impossible in private conferences and is difficult in public conferences because participants still have to register to the CarbonFreeConf platform and bombers could be found and prosecuted easily.</p>
             <p style="text-align: left"><strong>Start and End dates:</strong> Say when your conference starts and when it ends (even if there are gaps or days off in between). For parallel sessions, say when the session starts and finishes, just make sure it is well within the date range indicated for the main (called master) conference (see later).</p>
             <p style="text-align: left"><strong>Conference Size:</strong> Indicate how many people you expect. This is used to prepare your virtual room, which will be capped at the value indicated. Note that if you have more or less participants than anticipated, you can always change this number later.</p>
             <p style="text-align: left"><strong>Fees:</strong> You have two options: either 1) you pay the conference fees by yourself or 2) you choose the mode where every participants pay 20 euros per person. 1) With option 1, you can still decide that your participants must pay a fee to access your conference, then check the fee box. Once the box is checked you will have to enter the amount participants must pay (in euros, pounds or US dollars). Note that participants will be able to choose the currency they want to pay this amount. We will handle the payment and then redistribute it to you. There is also the option that you use the profit to offset more
                 carbon emissions and if you do, check the right box (and thank you for being altruistic). The last possibility is that you let people decide how much they give. In this case check the box that says participants can give what they want. If you choose the simpler option 2), you have nothing to pay to organize and every participant pay 20 euros, which contributes in paying for the offset of carbon emissions for the conference (it is a set amount even if you create a long multi-session conference).</p>
             <p style="text-align: left"><strong>Proceedings:</strong> Check the box if you want us to handle the proceedings of your participants. In this case, the participants will have to come on the platform to write their proceedings and we will publish them on our platform.</p>
             <p style="text-align: left"><strong>Subject:</strong> The subject indicates the main area the conference is dealing with (e.g. Astrophysics, Biology, Earth sciences, Literature, History, ...).</p>
             <p style="text-align: left"><strong>Parallel sessions:</strong> If you want to run several parallel sessions, then check this box. In this case, you will first have to create the main conference (called master conference later), which is where the plenary sessions will happen. Then you will come back on this page to create the parallel sessions (called daughter conferences). When creating your master conference, you will be given an ID number that must be provided to create the daughter conferences.
                 Once the daughter conference is created, it must be validated in the admin panel of the master conference for security reasons. </p>

             <h3 style="text-align: center" class="mb-3">Submit/Update conference</h3>
             <h5>The Submit/Update conference button should be used wisely.</h5>
             <p>The button <a href="#" class="btn btn-warning py-0"><strong>Submit conference</strong></a> at the bottom of the page should be used when you are ready for the info about your conference (e.g. title and abstract) to be accessible on our website, i.e. it does not mean more than that (e.g. it does not mean you have to pay anything).
             Before creating your conference website and inviting participants to register, it is better to submit to make it visible from the exterior.</p>
             <p>Once you have submitted, the button turns into <a href="#" class="btn btn-warning py-0"><strong>Update conference</strong></a>. Pushing the button one more time will update the schedule of your virtual conference. For instance, if you changed the program and that one day now starts at 8am instead of 9am, the new update will take that into account
                 and the virtual room will be opened earlier. So basically you should only update once when your program is set. You can do it a bit in advance as well to see if everything works well and one last time when your program is all set. It is useless to click this button too often.</p>
            <p><strong>Important:</strong> Just above the Submit/Update button, there is a box starting with the text: 'According to the program, the conference will proceed as follows (please check the dates and times carefully before you last submit)'. If anything is wrong in your program (e.g., it goes beyond the dates you had initially set-up), it will tell you there and you won't be able to submit or update.
                If everything is correct, you should anyway double check that the times listed in this box are what you expect as the conference opening and closing hours will be based on what is indicated in this box.

             <h3 style="text-align: center" class="mb-3">Pay</h3>
            <h5>Use the pay button to see how much you should pay to run your conference.</h5>
            <p>The pay button is at the bottom right of the page and looks like that <a href="#" class="btn btn-warning py-0"><strong>Pay</strong></a>. It will be disabled if you opted for the simpler 20 € per participant option because in this case you do not have to pay to organize the conference (i.e., it is easier for your institute and need no initial funding). Otherwise, click on the Pay button and fill out the form.</p>
             <p> The form is self-explanatory, just make sure to enter the name/address of the person or the name/address of the institute, whichever is paying. In case of a European institution paying, please provide its VAT number.</p>
             <p>Look at your cart at the top right of the page to check how much goes towards offsetting carbon emissions and the total you need to pay for. You can change the currency you will pay in below the cart and add coupons if you have any.</p>
             <p>The payment can either be made directly on this page via credit (or debit) card or contact us in advance if you want to proceed via a bank transfer instead.</p>
             <p><strong>Important:</strong> Note that once you have paid you cannot modify the conference dates or the number of participants unless you contact us. This is because you pay to offset a certain amount of carbon, which would change if you were to extend the conference for longer and/or add more participants. Wait until you are sure about your set-up before paying. Note that we will always try to find a solution if changes need to be made after the fact!</p>

             <h3 style="text-align: center" class="mb-3">Delete</h3>
            <h5>Why delete a conference?</h5>
            <p>You usually don't need to delete a conference as you can always modify it so that it fits the requirements you need. If you want to delete
            it anyway, use the <a href="#" class="btn btn-danger py-0"><strong>Delete Conference</strong></a> button at the bottom of the page. In this case, everything will be deleted and lost forever.</p>
