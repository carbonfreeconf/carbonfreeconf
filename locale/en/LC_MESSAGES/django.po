"        <h2>Offsetting carbon emissions in digital meetings</h2>\n"
"        <p>We spent a lot of time reviewing the best ways to offset carbon "
"emissions produced by our online conferences. Our policy on this is to use "
"techniques that are effective at actually removing CO<sub>2</sub> from our "
"atmospheres, in quantities, which can be measured accurately so that we know "
"we are offsetting the right quantity.</p>\n"
"        <p>So far we compensate using the (direct air capture) technology "
"offered by <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://climeworks."
"shop/how-it-works\">Climeworks</a>. They basically build big vacuum cleaners "
"that are sucking up some air from our atmospheres and storing the carbon "
"dioxide that goes through them. They then pump it underground and within a "
"few years the CO<sub>2</sub> reacts with rocks and turns into solid stones "
"that are permanently put off our atmosphere. Skeptical? Climeworks air "
"capture technique works efficiently and is indeed carbon negative as is "
"described <a href=\"https://chemrxiv.org/articles/preprint/"
"How_Carbon_Negative_Is_Direct_Air_Capture_Life_Cycle_Assessment_of_an_Industrial_Temperature-"
"Vacuum_Swing_Adsorption_Process/12833747/1?file=24363143\" rel=\"noopener\" "
"target=\"_blank\">in an independent paper</a>. For the carbon storage "
"underground, you can check this <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/"
"s43017-019-0011-8\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Nature paper</a> or "
"the whole ERC project about it called <a href=\"https://www.carbfix.com/\" "

"        <p>Another important part of the work is quantifying accurately how "
"much emission will be produced for a given conference, be it a 10 people "
"workshop for a day or a 1000 people conference for a week. For video "
"streaming during the conference, we assume that 40 g of CO<sub>2</sub> are "
"emitted per hour per person (international average) (<a href=\"https://www."
"carbonbrief.org/factcheck-what-is-the-carbon-footprint-of-streaming-video-on-"
"netflix\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">see source on CarbonBrief</a>). "
"Another way to get this number is to take the average electricity "
"consumption per Gb of transmitted data, which is ~0.04 kWh/Gb (which is the "
"average of the range given by the <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/commentaries/"
"the-carbon-footprint-of-streaming-video-fact-checking-the-headlines\" rel="
"\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">IEA</a> or see <a href=\"https://"
"onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jiec.12630\" rel=\"noopener\" "
"target=\"_blank\">Aslan et al. 2017</a> for a similar value). And then "
"convert it to (<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-020-1207-z"
"\">Burtscher et al. 2020</a>) the quantity of CO<sub>2</sub> emitted using "
"that it is 0.24 kg/kWh (see <a href=\"https://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-"
"maps/indicators/overview-of-the-electricity-production-2/assessment-4\">ref</"
"a>). For 4Mbps (similar to the Netflix average), it leads to 17 gCO2e. "
"Accounting for the electricity consumption of devices, this number goes up "
"by roughly a factor 2 (Burtscher et al. 2020), which is similar to the "
"previous value. We then reduce this value by a factor 2 to account for the "
"difference between the mean bitrate used by Netflix (4 Mbps) and that of our "
"tool (~2 Mbps for the default medium resolution). We then multiply by the "
"time the conference lasts and the number of participants and can work out "
"the final carbon dioxide mass emitted by the virtual conference that needs "
"to be offset.</p>\n"
"        <p>For conference video storage, we offset their emission over 3 "
"years based on the number of averaged views we could estimate but that will "
"be refined when we have more statistics from our website. After 3 years, the "
"organisers or their company will be contacted to check whether the videos "
"should be put offline (as some more recent conferences on the same field or "
"by the same participants may have already happened) or if they otherwise "
"want to keep on offsetting their produced carbon emissions (if the video is "
"still state-of-the-art).</p>\n"
"        <p>Finally we convert this mass of CO<sub>2</sub> that needs to be "
"offset in money. <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://"
"climeworks.shop/how-it-works\">Climeworks</a> needs 1 euro to offset 1 kilo "
"of CO<sub>2</sub> and bury it underground so that every hour of streaming "
"for each participant costs 0.02 € to offset or roughly 0.16 € (or 0.16 kg of "
"CO<sub>2</sub>) per day. Given this 0.16 € per day per person, you can "
"easily find an estimate of how much your conference will cost to offset. For "
"100 participants for 3 days, it would be 0.16 € * 100 persons * 3 days = 48 "
"€ (to offset 48 kg). But note that if you want the conference to be recorded "
"and hosted on our platform, there will be extra emissions to offset.</p>\n"
"        <p>You will be given a certificate from <a target=\"_blank\" rel="
"\"noopener\" href=\"https://climeworks.shop/how-it-works\">Climeworks</a> "
"that shows you the amount we paid to them and how much emission they offset "
"thanks to you. We are open to diversifying the ways we compensate carbon "
"emissions and if you have effective solutions to suggest, please <a href="
"\"mailto:sales@carbonfreeconf.com\">contact us</a>.</p>\n"
"        <p>Note that we developed a calculator (<a href=\"/%(LANGUAGE_CODE)s/"
"carbon-calculator\">see here</a>) for you to be able to quantify how much "
"emission your conference will produce (that needs to be offset).</p>\n"

"        <li>You can record the conference that would then be stored on our "

"\n"
"      <p>We spent a lot of time reviewing the best ways to offset carbon "
"emissions produced by our online conferences. Our policy on this is to use "
"techniques that are effective at actually removing CO<sub>2</sub> from our "
"atmospheres, in quantities, which can be measured accurately so that we know "
"we are offsetting the right quantity. So far we compensate using the (direct "
"air capture) technology offered by <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" "
"href=\"https://climeworks.shop/how-it-works\">Climeworks</a>. They basically "
"build big vacuum cleaners that are sucking up some air from our atmospheres "
"and storing the carbon dioxide that goes through them. They then pump it "
"underground and within a few years the CO<sub>2</sub> reacts with rocks and "
"turns into solid stones that are permanently put off our atmosphere.</p>\n"
"      <p>Another important part of the work is quantifying accurately how "
"much emission will be produced for a given conference, be it a 10 people "
"workshop for a day or a 1000 people conference for a week. For video "
"streaming during the conference, we assume that <strong>20 g of CO<sub>2</"
"sub> are emitted per hour per person (international average)</strong> (<a "
"href=\"https://www.carbonbrief.org/factcheck-what-is-the-carbon-footprint-of-"
"streaming-video-on-netflix\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">see source "
"here</a>). We then multiply by the time the conference lasts and the number "
"of participants and can work out the final carbon dioxide mass emitted by "
"the virtual conference that needs to be offset. We find that a rough "
"estimate for offsetting is that it costs 0.16 € per person per day (<a href="
"\"/offset\">see more here</a>).</p>\n"
"      <p>For conference video storage, we offset their emission over 3 years "
"based on the number of averaged views we could estimate but that will be "
"refined when we have more statistics from our website. After 3 years, the "
"organisers or their company will be contacted to check whether the videos "
"should be put offline (as some more recent conferences on the same field or "
"by the same participants may have already happened) or if they otherwise "
"want to keep on offsetting their produced carbon emissions (if the video is "
"still state-of-the-art).</p>\n"
"      <p>Finally we convert this mass of CO<sub>2</sub> that needs to be "
"offset in money. <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://"
"climeworks.shop/how-it-works\">Climeworks.</a> needs 1 euro to offset 1 kilo "
"of CO<sub>2</sub> and bury it underground so that every hour of streaming "
"for each participant costs 0.02 € to offset <strong>or roughly 0.16 € (or "
"0.16 kg of CO<sub>2</sub>) per day</strong>. Given this 0.16 € per day per "
"person, you can easily find an estimate of how much your conference will "
"cost to offset. For 100 participants for 3 days, it would be 0.16 € * 100 "
"persons * 3 days = 48 € (to offset 48 kg). But note that if you want the "
"conference to be recorded and hosted on our platform, there will be extra "
"emissions to offset.</p>\n"

"    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>\n"
"    <h3>Can I organize a conference for 5000 persons with different rooms "
"running simultaneously?</h3>\n"
"    <p>This is possible. When you create a conference, first create a master "
"conference, which will host the master website of the conference and the "
"plenary sessions. Then you get a code that can be given to researchers that "
"want to organize the different sessions within this conference. They can go "
"and create their meeting on <a href=\"/%(LANGUAGE_CODE)s/\">CarbonFreeConf</"
"a> and then just say it is a daughter conference and give the master "
"conference code to get it linked.</p>\n"
"    <h3>Do I have access to all the tools with the free version?</h3>\n"
"    <p>Yes you do. The free version is for meetings with less than 50 "
"participants for one day. The only thing that you cannot have for free is a "
"very reactive human to fix issues that may arise. To get this support, you "
"have the option to pay some additional fees in the free version (you will "
"see the option to tick when you go to the payment section).</p>\n"
"    <!-- <h3>Can I cancel my workshop and get the money back to the "
"participants?</h3>\n"

"you can do anything more. For them to register, you will first create your "

"panel. You can then click on 'Registered' to see if they applied for a "
"<strong>talk, poster or attendance only</strong> and can modify/validate the "
"talk and change the user's role (e.g. if you want them to be "
"<strong>moderator</strong> in the conference room on the big day, or members "
"of the <strong>program committee</strong>, and/or <strong>superusers</"
"strong> so that they have admin powers and can access the admin panel and "

"you decide if the participation is a normal talk or a review, discussion, "

"conference website but they will appear in the 'Other participants that "

"        <dt>- Third tab (program):</dt>\n"
"        <dd>Now you can start filling in the program. <strong>It is "

"participation.</dd>\n"
"        <dt>- Fourth tab (your conference website):</dt>\n"
"        <dd>It is now time to create your conference website. Go to the "
"'your conference website' tab and fill in the text that will appear on "
"<strong>your conference website homepage</strong> as well as the rationale "
"of the conference that will be displayed on the website. <strong>You can "
"personalize the text (highlight, larger font, add links, images, "
"videos, ...)</strong> using the tools provided in each box. Once this is "
"done, click the 'Create Conference Website' button. You can then click the "
"'checkout the conference website' button to see what it looks like.</dd>\n"
"        <dt>- Fifth tab (conference test room):</dt>\n"
"        <dd> This tab gives you access to an example of conference room, "
"where you can test all different possibilities before the big day. You can "

"conference and set it up together.</dd>\n"
"        <dt>- Sixth and last tab (chat room):</dt>\n"
"        <dd>This tab gives you access to the different rooms (one for "
"organizers and one for everybody) created for you in the chat area. If you "
"want to create more private groups, you can do so in this tab. Just choose "
"the title for the new group, set a description and topic, and choose who "
"should be included in this group among your participants. It is better to "
"wait until all participants have subscribed so that you don't have to add "
"them manually to the new group later on in the chat room settings.</dd>\n"
"      </dl>\n"
"    </section>\n"
"    <section>\n"
"      <p>4) Now you are all set, you should start adding the persons that co-"
"organize the conference with you. Once they register you can give them the "
"<strong>superuser status</strong> (by clicking the 'Registered' button in "
"the participants panel) so that they can access the admin panel with you, "
"add participants, modify the program and access the test room to check the "
"functionalities and meet with the organization panel.</p>\n"
"    </section>\n"
"    <section>\n"
"      <p>5) When ready, click the 'Submit conference' button at the bottom "
"of the screen so that you conference starts appearing on our website. You "
"will need to <strong>click this button each time you make big changes to the "
"conference</strong> (e.g. change schedule start and/or end times, conference "
"parameters, ...).</p>\n"
"    </section>\n"
"    <section>\n"
"      <p>6) You can now have a look at the conference room. <strong>You are "
"provided with a test room up until the big day</strong> and you can meet "
"there as often as you'd like with the other organizers. You and co-"
"organizers are set as moderators so that you can play with the different "
"parameters available in the conference room (moderators can see a black box "
"in the conference room that other participants do not see). <strong>For "
"instance you can allow people to chat, tweet results, change roles</strong> "
"(e.g. if an attendee wants to present something quickly you can give them "
"the right).</p>\n"
"    </section>\n"
"    <section>\n"
"      <p>7) If you checked the box to have your participants write "
"proceedings after the conference, you can go check what the "
"<strong>proceeding interface looks like</strong>. Go to the top menu and "
"click on your login (top right) and then 'My proceedings'. You can start "
"filling in your proceeding and leave it as a draft so that nobody can see. "
"You can use <strong>latex formula and add bibliography</strong> using bib "
"latex as described on the 'My proceedings' page.</p>\n"
"    </section>\n"
"    <section>\n"
"      <p>8) You can pay whenever you want but <strong>before the conference "
"starts</strong> as otherwise the conference would automatically be "
"cancelled. Don't forget that once you paid the number of participants cannot "
"be changed anymore nor the starting and ending dates (unless you contact us) "
"because it would change the carbon offset you already paid for.</p>\n"
"    </section>\n"
"    <section>\n"
"      <p>9) We also invite you to have a look in the archives to check "
"existing <a href=\"/archive\">recorded conferences</a>, and/or <a href=\"/"
"archive-proceedings\">proceedings</a>.</p>\n"
"    </section>\n"
"    <section>\n"
"      <p>10) Organizers and the committee are provided with a private room "
"to chat about the conference if a video call is not necessary. Note that "
"there is <strong>another room created for your conference for all the "
"participants</strong> and they can start using it as soon as you accept "
"their participations in the admin panel. You can also create some additional "
"rooms (we create a coffee break room by default for you) with a selected "
"subset of participants if you go to the chat room tab.</p>\n"
"    </section>\n"
"    <section>\n"
"      <p>11) If you allowed poster presentations, there will also be a room "
"attributed to each poster that will be accessible when going to the poster "
"area and clicking on an individual poster. <strong>Video calls or chat can "
"be used to talk to the poster presenter and the latter can even record their "
"voice</strong> (if they wish to do so) to explain what their poster is about "
"for when they are not around. The voice recording will be accessible via the "
"poster's private room to each participant.</p>\n"
"    </section>\n"
"    <section>\n"
"      <p>12) Your conference will start being accessible every day one hour "
"before the official time set up on the schedule. It is accessible to "
"presenters, moderators and superusers. This is for you to set-up the "
"conference room and also for presenters to test the virtual interface and "
"see if everything works properly.</p>\n"

"    <h2>Tips, tricks, advices for creating a virtual conference</h2>\n"
"    <section>\n"
"      <p>1) You have permanent access to test rooms to <strong>organize your "
"conference-related meetings</strong>. You can come and meet with your co-"
"organizers in this test room and start getting familiar with the multiple "
"possibilities opened to you when you actually manage the conference on the "
"big day. You can also meet with the program committee (decision panel) "
"members in these test rooms to, e.g., pick the right list of attendees, "
"decide on who you give a talk to, ... <strong>Other participants (that are "
"not superusers or part of the organizers/decision panel) are not allowed in "
"test rooms and everything that is said can thus be kept secret.</strong></"
"p>\n"
"    </section>\n"
"    <section>\n"
"      <p>2) If you organize a conference with more than 20 participants, "
"that may be handy to fill in your participant list in an <strong>Excel file</"
"strong> which can then be inputted in your administration panel rather than "
"adding participants one by one.</p>\n"
"    </section>\n"
"    <section>\n"
"      <p>3) You can send emails to your participants and/or organization "
"committee from the admin panel. <strong>There are many options to select the "
"right people you want to send emails to</strong> (e.g. unregistered "
"participants, members of the decision panel, persons with invited talks or "
"posters, ...). Note that you can select several of these lists together and "
"persons happening to be in multiple lists will only receive one email. "
"<strong>You can also add a link to your conference website into your email "
"and/or a link to the conference room</strong> for the big day by clicking on "
"'Copy link to...' below the message box when writing the email. You can also "
"send individual emails by clicking on the <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3."

"talk to add it to your program. <strong>It will then copy all information "
"(such as abstract, title, speaker's name, ...) directly into the program "
"scheduler and it will be visible on your conference website</strong>. You "
"will just have to position this new talk at the right time you want.</p>\n"
"    </section>\n"
"    <section>\n"
"      <p>5) Ahead of the conference and as soon as your participants have "
"their participations accepted, they can add slides or posters on your "
"conference website (they have to go to 'my participations') that will be "
"uploaded on our side and can be retrieved by you or other participants (or "
"made public).</p>\n"
"    </section>\n"
"    <section>\n"
"      <p>6) You can decide to ask for a small participation fee to all of "
"your participants (if the conference is not free on our side) so that the "
"overall cost is shared across many people. Your organization/institute can "
"even make profits. You can then decide to use this extra money to offset "
"more carbon emissions than produced by your virtual meeting or that it is "
"paid to you (which we do not encourage unless it is for a good cause, e.g. "
"offsetting carbon emissions at your intitute, paying for a poster/research "
"prize at the end of your conference, ...). For instance asking for a small "
"amount of 20 € to each of the 100 potential participants already covers the "
"expenses for the conference and CO<sub>2</sub> offset (about 260 € for three "
"days) and leaves a <strong>profit of about 1,500 €</strong>.</p>\n"
"    </section>\n"
"    <section>\n"
"      <p>7) Three private rooms (one for organizers, one for all "
"participants and one for coffee breaks) will be automatically created</"
"strong> in the chat area. If you want, you can create more private rooms and "
"invite the specific participants that can access each of them (through the "
"chat room tab). Wait until all participants have subscribed as otherwise "
"they will not be visible in the chat tab.</p>\n"
"    </section>\n"
"    <section>\n"
"      <p>8) If posters are allowed, you should tell poster presenters that "
"they can use the private rooms dedicated to their posters in the chat area "
"to produce a voice recording that can be listened by other participants. "
"This recording should explain quickly what the poster is about and the main "
"results and it will always be accessible throughout the conference. You may "
"also want to have <strong>some time dedicated to poster in your schedule</"
"strong> where presenters would be present and participants could call them "
"or chat with them about their posters.</p>\n"
"    </section>\n"
"    <section>\n"
"      <p>9) Each day the backstage of the conference becomes accessible one "
"hour before the official launch time. You should tell <strong>presenters "
"from the first session to come early and test their presentations</strong> "
"before it goes live. You could plan for 30min breaks between each session "
"that chairs/moderators can use for giving the opportunity to presenters from "
"the coming session to test the virtual interface and see if they can access "
"their presentations without any issue.</p>\n"
"    </section>\n"
"    <section>\n"
"      <p>10) If you record the presentations, you can either push the record "
"button once in the virtual room or record talks one by one by stopping the "
"recording when necessary. If the latter, the talks will then be uploaded one "
"by one on our side and you will be able to give a different title to each of "
"them (e.g. for each different speakers).</p>\n"

"            <h5>Interactions during a CarbonFreeConf virtual conference</"
"h5>\n"
"\n"
"            <p>CarbonFreeconf conferences encourage interaction via chat and "
"video to exchange freely about ideas or new results. These discussions, be "
"it with a peer, an attendee, the support team, administrative staff (or any "
"other person on the platform) should be orchestrated with respect, tact and "
"mindfulness.</p>\n"
"\n"
"            <p>Each person connecting to the video conferencing platform "
"(presenters, organizers, technical staff, ...) should use appropriate and "
"respectful language during the interactions, be it by video, chat, or audio. "
"It is requested to discuss the results of your peers without engaging in "
"personal attacks. Violation of this principle will not be tolerated. As "
"conferences are often international, we ask you to be respectful of cultural "
"differences that may emerge during exchanges. Participants should remain "
"professional and treat each other with mutual respect when interacting on "
"the platform or in any written or oral forms produced and accessible on "
"CarbonFreeConf.</p>\n"
"\n"
"            <p>Discriminatory behavior of any kind will not be tolerated (e."
"g. on origin, religion, age, gender, sexual orientation, disability, ...).</"
"p>\n"
"\n"
"            <p>If you detect such behavior (discrimination, disrespect, "
"inappropriate language, personal attacks, ...) towards others or yourself, "
"you should contact the conference organizers as soon as possible. Take care "
"to enrich your complaint with evidence such as screenshots for example. The "
"organizers will decide what action to take and depending on the offence, "
"this may lead to the blocking of access to the conference.</p>\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"            <h5>Timing of the conference</h5>\n"
"\n"
"            <p>The time constraints during virtual conferences are much more "
"burdensome than for face-to-face conferences. The virtual platform is "
"scheduled for a certain duration that cannot be changed once the conference "
"has started. For this reason, and out of respect for other participants and "
"organizers, we ask you to respect your allocated time limit. If you go "
"beyond your talk time, there will be less time for the question part. If you "
"go beyond the total time including the questions, the moderators will have "
"the right to disconnect you and move on to the next presentation.</p>\n"
"\n"
"            <p>Make sure you are present when your talk starts and that you "
"have tested in advance how to load your presentation on the platform (the "
"organizers have slots before each session for this kind of tests). If you "
"cannot attend, please inform the organizers as soon as possible. If "
"necessary, you can pre-record your presentation and upload it on the "
"conference website. This will make your presentation accessible to the "
"chairs who will be able to show it to your peers during your time slot. If "
"it is too late to record your talk on the platform (because the conference "
"has started), you can register yourself and send the video to the organizers "
"who can easily upload it on the platform.</p>\n"
"\n"
"            <h5>Respect privacy</h5>\n"
"\n"
"            <p>All conferences take place in a closed environment, which "
"means that you have to register beforehand to be able to participate in the "
"virtual conference, access the posters or the chat. Login information is "
"confidential and should not be shared with others. You must use your real "
"name on the platform and not impersonate someone else's name. Remember to "
"log out of the platform when you are in a non-private area and someone could "
"take control of your session.</p>\n"
"\n"
"            <h5>Publishing content from the conference</h5>\n"
"\n"
"            <p>It is easy to make screenshots or even record all or part of "
"the conference from your computer. However, if you wish to use this content "
"to put it online (e.g. social media, websites, applications), you should ask "
"the presenter and the organizers for their approval.</p>\n"
"\n"
"            <p>It is possible to post some information or slides from a talk "
"on social media (e.g. Facebook, twitter, ...) if it is for academic purposes "
"unless it is explicitly forbidden by the speaker at the beginning of his "
"presentation. As a speaker, mention it orally or in writing on your first "
"slide if it bothers you that your results and/or slides are shared online "
"outside of CarbonFreeConf.</p>\n"
"\n"
"            <h5>Good practice for every participant</h5>\n"
"\n"
"            <p>It's a good use for presenters and chairs to turn on their "
"cameras and try to make sure there's enough light to see the people "
"speaking. This seems more natural and allows non-native speakers of the "
"spoken language to follow better as well as for people who are hard of "
"hearing.</p>\n"
"\n"
"            <p>People with questions can ask them on the conference room "
"chat (Q&A) before the end of the presentation. At the end of the "
"presentation, either the chair or each person with a question relays it "
"orally. It is a good idea to activate your camera when you ask a question. "
"In all other cases, please deactivate your microphone and camera. When it is "
"not your turn to speak, please do not interrupt the presenter and do not "
"touch their slides or change any parameter in the virtual room.</p>\n"
"\n"
"            <p>If you want to hide your background, there is the possibility "
"to put a red, blue or green background behind you and to load an image-like-"
"background that will be automatically set up if it detects a uniformly "
"colored background behind you.</p>\n"
"\n"
"            <p>Try to be in a quiet place during the presentation and close "
"enough to your microphone (e.g., don't walk away from the microphone during "
"your presentation). To make sure that people with visual impairments can "
"follow your talk, please convey all the important elements orally and not "
"just on the slides.</p>\n"
"\n"
"            <p>Make your slides legible, preferably with a uniform "
"background and fairly large text with colours that can be seen by colour-"
"blind people.</p>\n"
"\n"
"            <h5>Good practice for Chairs</h5>\n"
"\n"
"            <p>We will list several recommendations to enable successful "
"sessions with a climate that participates in the creation and sharing of "
"ideas.</p>\n"
"\n"
"            <p>Before each session the chair should remind some rules of "
"decorum, such as respect for other participants in all circumstances. If the "
"conference is recorded, the chair should remind the participants. It should "
"also make participants understand that the agreement of the organizers and "
"presenters is required to publish a recording or complete slides online "
"outside of CarbonFreeConf. There is the possibility of sharing new results "
"on social networks (e.g. one finding, a few slides) if the author has not "
"expressed any opposition at the beginning of his presentation (written or "
"orally).</p>\n"
"\n"
"            <p>The chairs must ensure that the sessions end on time because "
"the following sessions are already pre-programmed and the conference will "
"have to be cut at a pre-determined time. As a courtesy for the last "
"sessions, and for the speakers, it is therefore necessary to be able to "
"finish on time. If a presenter is too long, his or her question time will "
"have to be shortened, and if he or she goes beyond the overall time "
"allotted, they will have to be cut off and move on to the next presentation."
"</p>\n"
"\n"
"            <p>Questions should be asked through the Q&A on the chat. The "
"chairs (and moderators) can then choose which questions are posted to the "
"participants. Questions that are personal, aggressive or disrespectful "
"should not be posted by chairs. Then chairs should choose who asks the "
"questions and in what order. A chair should question themselves about their "
"unconscious biases and try not to choose questions from the same people all "
"the time. If the chair asks all the questions, they must remember to mention "
"the name of the questioner.</p>\n"
"\n"
"            <p>If someone intervenes (orally or on the chat) disrespectfully "
"or inappropriately, the chair must warn that this behavior cannot be "
"tolerated here. If after a first warning the participant repeats this "
"behavior, the chair may eject the person from the virtual room.</p>\n"
